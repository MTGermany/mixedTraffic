This is an interactive simulation of the fully two-dimensional model
which is fully 
documented in following reference:<br>

At present, only landscape-like viewports are supported, so the
width of the simulation screen should be greater than the height (3:2
works well).<br><br>
The simulation starts with little traffic on a homogeneous road (the
U-bend is only there in order to display a longer road segment) with a
small downstream bottleneck realized by a road narrowing.
<br><br>
There
are two insert diagrams: a speed-density box-whisker plot at the top,
and a
flow-density scatter plot at the bottom. After each aggregation
interval (presently, set to 3 s), an additional box-whisker element and
data point is added to each plot, respectively. The plots give the
global picture over the whole simulation area, i.e., the
flow-densitry data approximate a macroscopic fundamental diagram and
the boxes of the speed-density plot are longest for phase-segregated
traffic, i.e., jammed in one portion and free in another.   <br><br>

Furthermore, there
are three possibilities for interaction: The sliders, the buttons to
the right, and loading a custom initial configuration

<h2> The sliders</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <i>Timewarp</i> controls the time-lapse factor simulated time
    progression <i>vs.</i> real time progression</li><p>
    
  <li> <i>Inflow</i> controls the traffic demand</li><p>
    
  <li><i>MaxOutflow</i> installs a bottleneck at the outflow and thus
    controls the maximum outflow. By controlling the Inflow and Max
    Outflow sliders, a complete simulated flow-density scatter plot can be
      created in the lower right insert diagram:
      <ul>
	<li> The free branch is
	  controlled by the inflow with MaxOutflow set to 100%</li><p>
	  <li> The congested branch is controlled by MaxOutflow with
	    the Inflow set to the maximum</li><p>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <li> The sliders <i>FracTruck</i> and  <i>FracBike</i> control the
  traffic composition of the respective vehicle types with the
  remaining percentage (if any) consisting of 
    cars</li><p>

  <li> The last four sliders control selected model parameters,
    see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05076">the paper</a>:
    <ul>

      <li> <i>&tau;<sub>lat,OVM</sub></i> is the time constant for the
	lateral Optimal Velocity Model (see Chapter 10 of
	<a href=
    "http://www.springer.com/physics/complexity/book/978-3-642-32459-8"><i>
    Traffic  Flow Dynamics</i></a> for the normal OVM)
 controlling the lateral 
      motion. The lower <i>&tau;<sub>lat,OVM</sub></i>, the faster
	lateral movements are adapted to the desired ones (which are
    often zero) 
      </li><p>

      <li> <i>sens<sub>dvy</sub></i> is a new experimental parameter
      introducing relative speeds to the OVM-like lateral
	dynamics. This avoids lateral crashes for
	larger <i>&tau;<sub>lat,OVM</sub></i> values (approx &gt; 1
      s). For simulating the original model
      in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05076">the paper</a>,
      set <i>sens<sub>dvy</sub></i>=0. 
      </li><p>

     <li>The <i>push<sub>lat</sub></i> factor p</i> determines to
      which extent 
      back vehicles are taken into account when moving
      laterally. For <i>push<sub>lat</sub>=0</i>,
      the followers are exclusively
      responsible for avoiding crashs and the leaders do not look
      behind (not yet in the paper). For <i>push<sub>lat</sub>=1</i>, the
      followers "push" the leaders aside to the same amount as
      the leaders the followers (<i>actio=reactio</i>)
      For simulating the original model
      in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05076">the paper</a>,
      set <i>push<sub>lat</sub></i>=0.
</li><p>

     <li>The <i>push<sub>long</sub></i> factor p</i> acts similarly
      for the longitudinal dynamics. For <i>push<sub>long</sub>=0</i>,
      we have car-following, and for <i>push<sub>long</sub>=1</i>
      pure <i>actio=reactio</i>. Notice that, as in the backwards
      longitudinal interaction from the leader, only the
      follower with the strongest forward interaction is selected. 
      Notice that there is no longer a "normal" fundamental diagram
      for <i>push<sub>long</sub>=1</i> and, instead, the flow
      increases always with the density.
      Increasing  <i>push<sub>long</sub></i> increases the capacity. For
      simulating the original model 
      in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05076">the paper</a>,
      set <i>push<sub>long</sub></i>=0.

</li><p>
</ul>
</ul>


<h2> The buttons/switch areas</h2>

<ul>
  <li> The <i>Display Forces</i> toggle indicates, if on,
    the actual acceleration vector
    for each vehicle by an arrow (the simulation needs to be running
    to see the effect of this button)
    
  <li> The <i> Var. Width Left</i> and  <i> Var. Width Right</i>
  toggles introduce bottlenecks as predefined road narrowings at the right and
  left sides, 
  respectively. Activating both bottlenecks simultaneously takes the model to its limits
    
  <li> If the <i> Floor Field</i> toggle is on, lane-based traffic is
  simulated. This is introduced into the mixed traffic flow model by
  adding a floor field producing lateral forces whenever a car or a
  truck is not at the center of one of the five lanes. The bike
  drivers, however, drive just between the lanes. Since they are
  sufficiently wide, bike drivers can overtake and be
    overtaken.
    <ul>
      <li> Notice how the vehicles spontaneously order when
	switching this toggle on
	<li> destroying the lanes by switching the floor
  field off may lead to more effective mixed flow in congested
  conditions, particularly in the presence of congestions/stronger bottlenecks
  (create congestion by increasing the inflow, switching on Var Width
  Left or Right, or  
    reducing MaxOutflow)
    <li>
    Notice that the floor field a.k.a lanes is only sensible if there
    are no significant road narrowings. Otherwise, the vehicles may
    leave the road...
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2> Custom initial conditions (micro ICs)</h2>

The simulation can be customized by prescribing arbitrary microscopic initial
conditions and road-blocking bottlenecks as specified in text
files 
prescribing the type, initial longitudinal and lateral position
(u,v),  and initial velocity
(speedLong,speedLat)  of any
object. Pressing the button "IC from file" opens a file selector for
user-supplied files. Once selecting one, the simulation is cleared and
re-run with
the user-supplied vehicle configuration (the geometric bottlenecks are retained from the previous setting). The
file format is as follows:
<pre>
 # type     length   width  u     v       speedLong  speedLat
 car        5.0      2.0    20    3       15         0
 truck      10.0     3.0    20    -3      15         0
 bike       2.0      1.0    40    -3      5          1
 obstacle   80       2      300   9.5     0          0
 ...        ...      ...    ...   ...     ...        ...
</pre>
Examples can be downloaded
at
the <a href="https://github.com/MTGermany/mixedTraffic/blob/master/README.md">GitHub 
  link </a> or from the links further below. Besides the three moving types <tt>car</tt>, <tt>truck</tt>,
and <tt>bike</tt>, there is also a 
type <tt>obstacle</tt> which can be used to implement various road-blocking
bottlenecks. <br>

Micro ICs are useful when analyzing certain model aspects with
reproducible scenarios. For this reason, I also seed the random number
generator when a new
IC file is loaded. This is necessary because a certain acceleration noise is added
to resolve stalemates in the traffic flow (see file
IC_resolveStalemate.txt below). When using micro ICs, it is best to set the inflow to
zero because otherwise new incoming vehicles may disturb the
analysis/experiments. With zero inflow, there are also no further stochastic
elements in the simulation in addition to the 
acceleration noise. Notice that the simulation is cleared from all
past vehicles and past obstacles and bottlenecks when a new
IC file is loaded but the other slider settings are unchanged. <br>

As examples and templates for further modification, you
can download several template initial 
configurations.

<br><br><i>Hint:</i> The filename indicates that the configurations work
as intended for a road width of 3.5 m times the given number of lanes.
furthermore, you should deactivate the "Var width*" geometry
settings and set the inflow to zero because, otherwise, the additional
inflow vehicles will interfere. You can also try if a given
configuration works better with lanes (floorfield on) or without)

  navigating through a big obstacle parcours</a>. The obstacles are
  virtual standing vehicles</li>
    
        
<li> <a href="IC-configurations/IC_5lanes_overtakingBetwTrucks.txt">A car and a bike
  overtaking some slower trucks in the middle</a>. This is more effective
  with lanes since, otherwise, the space between the trucks is quite
  narrow. Without lanes, it is only possible if the lateral pushing
  factor  is
  above about <i>push<sub>lat</sub>=0.3</i> since, otherwise, the
  trucks in front do 
  not care and the initial space is too low. Also with lanes, lateral
  pushing helps. Can also be done with a width of 10.5 m (3 lanes)</li>
    
<li> <a href="IC-configurations/IC_2lanes_zipper.txt">A very strong road narrowing down to one
  lane</a>. Some cooperation is necessary so that everyone can pass the
  bottleneck. This brings the model to its limits since no explicit
  cooperation is built into the drivers, so quite a chaos
  occurs. Best (i.e., shortest time for all vehicles traversing the
  simulation) is with lanes and longitudinal and lateral pushing activated</li>

<li> <a href="IC-configurations/IC_2lanes_4carsParallel.txt"> This
    visualizes the amount of stochasticity</a> (in form of acceleration
    noise) that is built into the simulator because, without noise,
